## Abstract
Despite their weak nature, van der Waals (vdW) interactions have been shown to effectively control the optoelectronic and vibrational properties of layered materials. However, how vdW effects exist in Ruddlesden–Popper layered halide perovskites remains unclear. Here we reveal the role of interlayer vdW force in Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite in regulating phase-transition kinetics and carrier dynamics based on high-quality epitaxial single-crystalline (C4H9NH3)2PbI4 flakes with controlled dimensions. Both substrate–perovskite epitaxial interaction and interlayer vdW interaction play significant roles in suppressing the structural phase transition. With reducing flake thickness from ∼100 to ∼20 nm, electron–phonon coupling strength decreases by ∼30%, suggesting the ineffectiveness of phonon confinement of the natural quantum wells. Therefore, the conventional understanding that vdW perovskite is equivalent to a multiple quantum well has to be substantially amended due to significant nonlocal phononic effects in the layered crystal, where intralayer interaction is not drastically different from the interlayer force.
